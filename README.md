Grim Dawn Stash Manager
=======================

This project includes a set of simple bash scripts to help Grim Dawn players
on Linux manage multiple shared stash files.

Grim Dawn has a couple of projects for managing item stashes, like [GDStash][1]
and [Grim Dawn Item Assistant][2]. GDStash works on Linux, but I didn't
have a good experience with it using the latest version. Grim Dawn Item
Assistant is not something I've ever been able to get working on Linux.

Rather than resort to mules, I whipped up these scripts to make
stash management more bearable.

**Important**: Don't perform stash management operations with the stash window
open while playing Grim Dawn. You can do stash management in-game; just make
sure that your stash isn't open.
